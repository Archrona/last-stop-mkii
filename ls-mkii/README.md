# Last Stop Mk. II

This directory contains the JavaScript front end of Last Stop. It's a typical React/Webpack app. Give it a try with `npm start`.

Last Stop has a high-performance core written in Rust which we pull in using WebAssembly. You can find it in `../ls-core`. The README there explains how to build it.
