# Last Stop Mk. II

Last Stop is a source code editor for users with RSIs who would like to dictate code by speech while leaving open the usual keyboard-and-mouse approach.

This editor relies on external software for the actual speech-to-text recognition. Options include Dragon and Google Speech-to-Text. Both of these are rather expensive. Support for native speech recognition in Windows is planned, but the quality will likely be lower than these paid options.
